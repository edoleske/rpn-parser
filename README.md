# RPN-Parser

This is a parser for expressions in Reverse Polish Notation using the ANTLR4 language recognition framework. Bash scripts are designed to be run from project root directory (01.1).

The following operators are supported:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponents (^)
- Variable Assignment (=)
- Basic Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Parenthesis (())

root (01.1):
- build.sh : Bash script used to build program from source files, uses javac and java system commands
- run.sh : Bash script used to execute program after compilation
- test.data : List of RPN expressions that program parses and evaluates
src:
- RPNParse.java : The entry point of the execution, which iterates over expressions given per line in test.data
- RPNCalculator.g4 : A grammar file used by the ANTLR4 framework for definitions
- RPNBaseVisitor.java : Definitions for operator rules defined in the grammar, overrides visit methods generated by ANTLR4
