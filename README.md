# RPN-Parser

This is a parser for expressions in Reverse Polish Notation using the ANTLR4 language recognition framework. Bash scripts are designed to be run from project root directory (01.1).

### Usage:
The build scripts supplied will compile and execute the program using "test.data" as a list of expressions. If you would like to supply your own expressions after compilation, either add them to that file or run the following command on UNIX systems:
```
java -cp build:lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar RPNParse [PATH-TO-FILE]
```
And on Windows systems:
```
java -cp ".\build;.\lib\antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar" RPNParse [PATH-TO-FILE]
```

The following operators are supported:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponents (^)
- Variable Assignment (=)
- Basic Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot)
- Parenthesis (())

### root (01.1):
- build.sh : Bash script used to compile and execute program, uses javac and java system commands
- build.bat : Above script that works on Windows systems
- test.data : List of RPN expressions that program parses and evaluates
### src:
- RPNParse.java : The entry point of the execution, which iterates over expressions given per line in test.data
- RPNCalculator.g4 : A grammar file used by the ANTLR4 framework for definitions
- RPNBaseVisitor.java : Definitions for operator rules defined in the grammar, overrides visit methods generated by ANTLR4
